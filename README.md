# pvrEzCommentBundle

If you are looking to run this bundle into eZ Publish 5.x, please switch to tag 1.x

### F.A.Q

- Why can't I find version 1.x ?

Well version 1.0 should has been the stable version of 0.x (compatible with eZ Publish 5.x). So I prefer to skip a version number and start version 2.x compatible with eZ Platform / Studio
